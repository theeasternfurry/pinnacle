## About

for Wayland.

## Features
- Tag system
- Dynamic tiling
- Customizable layouts
- Support for most wlr protocols
- Floating window support
- Xwayland support
- Configurable in Lua or Rust
- Is very cool üëç

## Special Thanks
- [Smithay](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay): For being a great compositor library and also allowing me not to deal with all the graphics stuff I still don't understand
- [Niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri): For all that rendering and protocol stuff I, ahem, *took inspiration* from. And session stuff. And the test fixture.
