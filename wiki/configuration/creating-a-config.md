# Creating a Config

The first time you boot up Pinnacle, it will start up with the default Rust config, which is built into the compositor.
Obviously, you probably want to change stuff. In that case, you'll want to generate a new config.

Run the config generator with the following command:
```sh
pinnacle config gen
```

This will start an interactive TUI where you can specify where to create a new config at, as well as what
language you want to use.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are rerunning the config generator, delete or rename any already existing files.
> Otherwise, the config generator will fail (it will not overwrite files).
