# Windows

Window management is a key part of any Wayland compositor. The window API
provides ways to manage windows, like fullscreening them, closing them, and more.

## Window Handles

Getting information about a window and controlling it happens through a window handle.
You can get a window handle through various means, like the `get_all` function, signals,
or window rules.

## Methods

Documentation for methods on window handles can be found at the corresponding API reference.

## Window rules

Unlike AwesomeWM and most Wayland compositors out there, Pinnacle does not have a declarative window rule system.
That is, you don't specify a list of conditions and applied rules directly. We do this because it introduces a split
between window rules and the rest of the window API. Instead, window rules give you a window handle when
a window opens that you can do whatever you want with.

To add a window rule, call `add_window_rule`.

::: tabs key:langs
== Lua
```lua
require("pinnacle.window").add_window_rule(function(window)
    if window:app_id() == "alacritty" then
        window:set_floating(true)
    end
end)
```
== Rust
```rust
window::add_window_rule(|window| {
    if window.app_id() == "alacritty" {
        window.set_floating(true)
    }
});
```
:::

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Try not to block inside of the window rule closure. Pinnacle will only configure the window once
> all window rules have finished executing. If you block here, there will be a delay before the window opens.
> If you deadlock here, the window will not open at all.

## Keyboard navigation

To navigate windows using the keyboard, call `WindowHandle::in_direction`.
This method returns all windows in the given direction relative to the `self` window,
sorted closest to farthest. You can then check if there is a first window returned and focus it:

::: tabs key:langs
== Lua
```lua
local focused = require("pinnacle.window").get_focused()
if focused then
    local wins_to_left = focused:in_direction("left")
    if wins_to_left[1] then
        wins_to_left[1]:set_focused(true)
    end
end
```
== Rust
```rust
if let Some(focused) = window::get_focused() {
    if let Some(closest_left) = focused.in_direction(Direction::Left).next() {
        closest_left.set_focused(true);
    }
}
```
:::

Note: The sort is geometry-based, so focusing across the tiled layout
may not be 100% intuitive. This may be an area of improvement in the future.

## On-demand variable refresh rate

Windows can be set to turn on variable refresh rate (VRR) on outputs with on-demand VRR.
See [Variable refresh rate](./outputs#variable-refresh-rate) for more information.
