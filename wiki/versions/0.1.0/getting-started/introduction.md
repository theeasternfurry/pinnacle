# Introduction

Pinnacle is a Wayland compositor written with [Smithay](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay)
and configured in either Lua or Rust. It's my attempt at making something similar to
[AwesomeWM](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome) for Wayland.

This wiki will provide you with information on how to get Pinnacle
up and running as well as configured to your liking.

> [!NOTE]
> This wiki is *not* the API reference. It is meant for quick overviews of the features Pinnacle has to offer.
> You will find a more exhaustive list of possible API calls in the corresponding API references in the header bar.
> 
> Also, the header bar links only link to the main branch's references for now.
> To change versions:
> - For the Lua reference, navigate to the version you want in the sidebar
> - For the Rust reference, change `main` in the URL to the version you want
